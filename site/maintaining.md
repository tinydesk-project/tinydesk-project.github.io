# Maintaining these docs

These pages (the documentation and the web installer) are plain Markdown
files kept apart from the code repositories. This page says what to update
when the code changes, and how the pages are written.

Before a release, check every link and `#anchor` between the pages:

```bash
python tools/check_links.py
```

## Where things go

Update the site in step with the code: a change that reaches users gets its
page updated before the release.

| Change in the code | Update in `site/` |
| --- | --- |
| a public function, struct, macro or callback in `include/tinydesk/`, `apps/td_apps.h`, `proto/` | the matching page in `api/` |
| a new `td_sysinfo_t` service or port hook | `api/sysinfo.md` and the port page |
| a new or changed shell command or option | `shell/commands.md` |
| a file format, settings byte, NVS key, partition | `shell/config-files.md` |
| keys, mouse actions, a new app, UI behaviour | `guide/using.md` (and `api/apps.md` for an app) |
| a new board or port change | `ports/`, `guide/install.md` and the installer (`install/index.html`) |
| a new board configuration key | `guide/board-config.md` (and, in the code, every `board.example.conf`) |
| a change in the shell (`third_party/tdsh`) | the shell repository's `CHANGELOG.md`, and the pages here that describe it |
| a new tool or tool option | `tools.md` |
| every release | `changelog.md`, the version in `_coverpage.md` |
| a new page | add it to `_sidebar.md` |

## Style

* Document what the code does, checked against the source. Copy
  prototypes exactly; say which task or thread may call a function, who
  owns returned memory, and the limits (sizes, timeouts, RAM).
* API pages: a short intro, `Header:` line, then groups of items. Each
  function: a `c` code block with the prototype, a description,
  parameters and return value, notes. Structs and enums: the definition,
  then a table of fields.
* Plain English, short sentences, tables for options.
* Links between pages are relative (`../api/wm.md`); sidebar links start
  with `/`. Link to a section with `page.md?id=heading-id`.

## Releases

Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); TinyDesk and
TinyDesk Shell have their own version numbers (both started at 0.1.0).

1. In the `tinydesk` repository set `PROJECT_VER` in
   `ports/esp32c6/CMakeLists.txt`, `ports/esp32/CMakeLists.txt` and
   `ports/esp32-4mb/CMakeLists.txt`, and `TD_VERSION` in
   `include/tinydesk/td.h`. A new shell version goes in the shell's
   `VERSION` and `TDSH_VERSION` (`include/tdsh.h`) with a `CHANGELOG.md`
   entry there.
2. Build the five firmware projects (`ports/esp32c6`, `ports/esp32`,
   `ports/esp32-4mb`, `third_party/tdsh`, `third_party/tdsh/projects/esp32`)
   and try the release locally:
   `python tools/make_release.py --site ../tinydesk-site/site`, then the
   installer with the new images.
3. If the shell changed, commit and push it in its own repository first,
   then commit the new submodule pointer in `tinydesk` (see
   [Contributing](contributing.md#working-on-the-shell)).
4. Tag `v<version>` in `tinydesk`: its `.github/workflows/release.yml`
   builds both editions for every platform and attaches the images and PC
   programs to a draft pre-release. Tag `v<shell version>` (the shell's
   `VERSION`) in `tinydesk-shell` too: its own release workflow publishes
   the Shell edition there, with the same file names. Review each draft
   on GitHub and publish it.
5. Here: add the `changelog.md` entry, set the version in `_coverpage.md`,
   push, and run the *GitHub Pages* workflow: it puts the newest published
   `tinydesk` release into the installer.
   **Once, after publishing 0.1.5:** boards running 0.1.3 or 0.1.4 look for
   updates at the old address, `https://schikani.github.io/tinydesk-docs/install/`
   (repository `schikani/tinydesk-docs`). Run that repository's *GitHub
   Pages* workflow once, so it serves 0.1.5 (update information and images),
   then archive the repository on GitHub: its site stays online, read-only.
   Those boards update to 0.1.5, which reads the new address, and from there
   to every later release. Never delete or rename `schikani/tinydesk-docs`,
   or create `tinydesk` or `tinydesk-shell` under `schikani` (that breaks
   GitHub's redirects to `tinydesk-project`).

## Generated reference (optional)

The headers carry the same information as comments. For a
symbol-by-symbol HTML index, Doxygen (installed with the MinGW toolchain)
can be run over `include/`, `apps/td_apps.h` and `proto/`; the hand-written
pages here stay the main reference because they also explain behaviour,
limits and board differences.
